This is a KDE plasmoid that shows reddit notifications
from the RSS feed of notifications from your reddit account.

It sits in the panel, and pops up if there is a new notification.
Clicking on a notification will open the relevant reddit page
in user's default browser.
Fun-fact: Clicking on the title in the plasmoid will take you
straight to reddit.com in your browser!

=INSTALL=========

Make sure you are running the KDE SC version >= 4.8.
You would also require the 'zip' package installed.
(Test by simply running the 'zip' command on console)

Make and install the plasmoid package from source:

$ cd reddit-notifier-kde-plasmoid/
$ sh install.sh

The plasmoid is now installed and can now be added to the desktop/panel
from the widgets list.

The source directory can also be safely deleted.

=USAGE==========

After the plasmoid is added, go to "Reddit Notifier Settings" by right-clicking
on the plasmoid, and enter your reddit account's RSS feed URL for
notifications. To get the feed URL, open your reddit account in a browser, go
to preferences, RSS feeds, and get the URL of the feed you want. Paste the URL
in plasmoid's settings box and click OK. This is a one-time procedure (whenever
you add the plasmoid) and the notifications will be synced on your desktop with
an interval of one minute.
